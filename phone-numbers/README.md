1) Take a look at the `Lookup` interface in 
[phonenumbers.scala](https://github.com/refried/scala-fp-exercises/blob/master/phone-numbers/src/main/scala/phonenumbers.scala) 
and the test cases in 
[PhoneSpec.scala](https://github.com/refried/scala-fp-exercises/blob/aryasolutions/phone-numbers/src/test/scala/PhoneSpec.scala)

2) Provide an implementation for phonenumbers.Solution.  Any of `val Solution = new Lookup { ... }`, 
or `object Solution extends Lookup { ... }` or `val Solution = new YourClass` will work.

3) Test with "sbt test"

4) discuss
